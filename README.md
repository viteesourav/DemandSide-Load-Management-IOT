# DemandSide-Load-Management-IOT

This Project represents a cyber physical System used to cope with mismatch between the Power Generation and Power Demand Curves.

## What is Energy Demand Management ?

Energy demand management, also known as demand-side management (DSM) or demand-side response (DSR), is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial incentives and behavioural change through education. Usually, the goal of demand-side management is to encourage the consumer to use less energy during peak hours, or to move the time of energy use to off-peak times such as night-time and weekends.

## What is our Objective in this Project ?

*Concepts of Machine Learning like Random Forest algorithm is being used to predict future generation and consumption pattern.
*A website was created to monitor consumers’ appliance record and present forecasted data to consumers’ and system operators’.
*A priority-based system has been developed, to reduce power consumption during peak hours and shift the use of heavy loads to off-peak hours, and has been implemented in the website.
*All the information are send to a micro-controller which uses pre-coded algorithms to operate relays, thereby providing power to run suitable appliances.
